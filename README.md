GenreGennie is a machine learning–based music genre classification system that uses audio signal processing to predict the genre of songs. It extracts MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) features from audio files, trains a Random Forest classifier, and provides predictions through an interactive Streamlit web app.

🚀 Features

🎶 Extracts MFCC features using Librosa

🧠 Trains a Random Forest classifier on labeled datasets

💾 Saves and loads the trained model with Joblib

🎧 Interactive Streamlit app for genre prediction

📊 End-to-end pipeline: preprocessing → training → prediction → deployment

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Librosa – audio feature extraction

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib – data handling and visualization

Scikit-learn – machine learning

Joblib – model persistence

Streamlit – web app interface
